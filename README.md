# Predict-the-Introverts-from-the-Extroverts

This repository contains my participation in the [Kaggle Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 7](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e7) competition. The goal is to classify individuals as "Introvert" or "Extrovert" based on provided tabular data.
